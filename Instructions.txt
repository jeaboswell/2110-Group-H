Okay, feel free to edit the .cpp and .h files. Just please don't edit any of the .proj, .sln, etc.

Add your own comments and change the comment at the top of the main.cpp file to have only your name.
  
So, download the two .cpp and one .h files from 2110-Group-H/Program 1/Program 1. You can remove any of the following things as you see fit:
  Anything that starts with #pragma (Basically all of the regions and the once in the header)
  
  This is code from the header file that can be removed: (If it has XREMOVEX in front of it you can remove it)
    XREMOVEX#ifdef _WIN32 // Windows compatibility
    XREMOVEX#include <Windows.h>
    XREMOVEX#include <conio.h>
    XREMOVEX#define CLEAR system("cls"); // Clear the comand prompt (screen)
    XREMOVEX#define SLEEP Sleep(1000); // Make program pause for one second before continuing
    XREMOVEX#define KEYPRESS cout << "Press any key to continue..."; _getch(); // "Press any key to continue..."
    XREMOVEX#elif __linux // Linux compatibility
    XREMOVEX#include <ncurses.h>
    
    #define CLEAR system("clear"); // Clear the comand prompt (screen)
    
    XREMOVEX#define SLEEP sleep(1); // Make program pause for one second before continuing
    XREMOVEX#define KEYPRESS cout << "Press any key to continue..."; cin.ignore(); // "Press any key to continue..."
    XREMOVEX#endif
    
    Basically from that block the only thing that should be kept is the CLEAR define within the linux section
