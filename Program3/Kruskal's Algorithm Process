Kruskal's Algorithm Process

1) Create a new list of edges that is a copy of the current list of edges.

2) Sort the new list:
    i) Look for and remove any loops (A-A)
    ii) Remove duplicate edges:
        * For edge A-B, there is also B-A. Remove B-A.
    iii) Order remaining edges from least to greatest.

3) Create a new list for the minimum spanning tree (MST)

4) Add the smallest edge in sotrted list to the MST and then remove it from sorted list.

5) Repeat step 4.

6) While the number of edges in MST does not equal the number of nodes - 1:
    i) Look at the smallest edge in sorted list.
    ii) Check if adding it causes a loop. (See Loop Check Process)
    iii) If it does not cause a loop, add it to the MST.
    iv) Remove the edge from sorted list.
    
7) Add duplicate edges back into MST. Reverse step 2(ii).
    * This allows for proper printing
