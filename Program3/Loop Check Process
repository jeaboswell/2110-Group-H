Loop Check Process (In regards to an edge)

1) Look for the start node of the edge in the MST. If it is not found, no loop will be created. If it is found, continue.

2) Look for the end node of the edge in the MST. If it is not found, no loop will be created. If it is found, continue.

3) Find all nodes connected to the start and end nodes of the edge, creating lists for each tree. (Recursive Function)
    * ONLY ADD NODES TO THE TREE IF THEY DO NOT ALREADY EXIST IN THE TREE.
    
4) Look for any node matches between the start and end node trees. If a match is found, a loop will be created, so don't add
   edge to the MST. If no match is found, no loop wil be created, so add the edge to the MST.
